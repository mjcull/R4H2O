![](resources/session0/r4h2o-logo.png)

Managing reliable water services requires not only a sufficient volume of water but also significant amounts of data. Water professionals continuously measure the flow and quality of water and asses how customers perceive their service. Water utilities are awash, or even flooded with data. Data professionals use data pipelines and data lakes and make data flow from one place to another.

Data and water are, as such, natural partners. Professionals in the water industry rarely directly interact with water or customers, but they are constantly analysing data that describes these realities. Analysing data maintains or improves the level of service to customers and minimises the impact on the natural environment.

Most professionals use spreadsheets to collect and analyse data and present the results. While these tools are convenient, they are not ideal when working with large and complex sets of data. Specialists in data analysis prefer to write code in one of the many available computing languages.

This course introduces water utility professionals to the [R language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) for data science. This language is one of the most popular and versatile tools among data scientists to create value from data.

The content of this course represents a steep learning curve because we take a deep dive into the functionalities of the R language. Just keep in mind: 

>The steeper the learning curve, the larger to payoff.

This workshop is not an exhaustive introduction into data science programming, but a teaser to inspire water professionals to ditch their spreadsheets and instead write code to analyse data. The best way to learn to solve problems with computer code is to start with practical examples and learn the principles as you progress through ever more complex cases.

This course discusses the basics of using the R language with a limited scope. This course does not include advanced techniques such as machine learning. All data used in this course is tabular, text analysis and other unstructured data are not part of the curriculum.

The course consists of seven sessions. The introduction introduces the principles of data science within the context of managing a water utility. The three case studies look at water quality data, customer perception and digital metering data. The case studies use material previously published on [The Devil is in the data](https://lucidmanager.org/data-science/), a blog about creating value and having fun with the R language.

Each of the case studies starts with a problem statement and introduces participants to the relevant aspects of the R language. Participants have to load, transform, explore and analyse the data to solve the stated problem.

## Principles of Water Utility Data Science
The [first session](#datascience) defines data science as an evolution of traditional analysis. The greater availability of data, enhanced computer capacity and tools to analyse this information have revolutionised the industry.

This course is not only about the vocabulary and syntax of R, but also about producing good data science. This session introduces a framework for best practice in analysing data and sharing the results. This framework derives from the book [Principles of Strategic Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/principles-strategic-data-science) by Peter Prevos. The three case studies each implement aspects of this framework.

## Case Study 1: Water Quality Regulations
In this [first case study](#casestudy1), participants apply their skills to laboratory testing data from an imaginary drinking water network. The case study revolves around checking the data for compliance with water quality regulations.

The analysis uses the Tidyverse library. The ![Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of extensions of the R language that simplifies manipulating, analysing and presenting data science.

## Visualising Data
The [fourth session](#tidyverse) delves into the basic principles of visualising data with the ggpot2 library, using data from the first case study.

## Case Study 2: Understanding Customer Perception
The data for the [second case study](#casestudy2) consists of the results of a survey of American consumers about their perception of tap water services. Participants use the Tidyverse to clean, transform and visualise this data.

## Data Products
The [fifth session](#dataproducts) focuses on the data science workflow as an iterative process to solve a data problem. A data product is the result of a data science project, which can be a report, website or an application.

This session also introduces R Markdown as a tool to report on the results of a data science project. In this session, students prepare a report to summarise the impact of proposed changes to water regulations on the data in the first case study.

## Case Study 3: Analysing Water Consumption
In the [last case study](#casestudy3), participants use the analytical functionalities of the Tidyverse to analyse data from smart meters to find anomalies in water consumption.

## Prerequisites
To participate in this workshop, you need to have some understanding of the issues surrounding water management. Experience with analysing data is also preferred. This course is designed with spreadsheet users in mind. Experience with writing computer code is helpful, but not required.

You also need access to a recent version of the R language and RStudio. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that simplifies working with R and data. To install this software, follow these steps:

* Go to the [R Project download](https://cran.r-project.org/) site.
* Download the *base* version for your operating system.
* Install the software.
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
* Download the installer for the free version for your operating system.
* Install the software.

You also need to install extensions of the R language through the package manager. If you are not using your own computer, check with the administrator to obtain this access.

Alternatively, you can sign-up for a free account to access the [cloud version](https://rstudio.cloud/) of R Studio. This account gives you full access to R Studio and R in your browser without the need to install any software. The cloud version is fully functional but not very fast. Installing R and RStudio on your laptop is the preferred method.
