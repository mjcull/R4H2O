## Quiz 1: Water Quality Regulations
The first step is to load the Gormsey data:

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
gormsey <- read.csv("session2/gormsey.csv")
```
### Question 1: How many results does the Gormsey data contain?
The `dim()` or `nrow()` function gives the number of rows in the data frame. This function indicates that the Gormsey data has 2879 rows.

This solutin assumes that all values are indeed available, which is the case in this data. The next case study discusses missing data.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
dim(gormsey)
nrow(gormsey)
```

### Question2: How many E Coli results were recorded?
We can compare each of the entries of the `measure` variable with "E Coli". This comparison results in a vector of boolean values. The `sum()` function results in the number of TRUE values because they count as 1 and FALSE counts as 0. The Gormsey data has 1470 E Coli results.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
sum(gormsey$Measure == "E Coli")
```

### Question 3: What is the data type of the Zone field?
Look at the structure of the data frame with the `str()` function. The data type is shown after the colon. The Zone field is a factor variable.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
str(gormsey)
```

### Question 4: How many E Coli results breached the regulations?
To answer this question we eed to find all E COli results with a value larger than zero and count them. There are two such results.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
nrow(gormsey[gormsey$Measure == "E Coli" & gormsey$Result > 0, ])
```

### Question 5: What is the median THM value for the Gormsey system?
The `median()` function provides the answer. All we need to do next is to subset the result vector for THM data.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
median(gormsey$Result[gormsey$Measure == "THMs"])
```

### Question 6: Which zone has breached the Victorian regulations for THM?
We can visualise the data to have a quick look. The red line inddicates the maximum. 
The subset function filters the Gormsey data for all THM results that breach the regultions. The numeric result confirms that the Merton water quality zone has two values larger than 0.25 mg/l.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
boxplot(Result ~ Zone, data = subset(gormsey, Measure == "THMs"))
abline(h = 0.25, col = "red")
subset(gormsey, Measure == "THMs" & Result > 0.25)
```

### Question 7: How many sample points have been used in the Pontybridge zone?
The `length()` function counts the nuber of elements in a vector. The `unique()` function shows each element of the vector only once.removes all duplicates from the vector.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
length(unique(gormsey$Sample_Point[gormsey$Zone == "Pontybridge"]))
```

### Question 8: Which zone shows the highest level of turbidity?
turbidity <- subset(gormsey, Measure == "Turbidity")
boxplot(Result ~ Zone, data = turbidity)
turbidity[turbidity$Result == max(turbidity$Result), ]

### Question 9: What is the lowest level of turbidity measured in the system?
min(turbidity$Result)

### Question 10: What is the 95^th^ percentile of the turbidity for each zone in the Gormsey system, using the Weibull method?
aggregate(turbidity$Result, list(turbidity$Zone), quantile, 0.95, method = 6)
